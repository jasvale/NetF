### Data
- All the data sets can be found in the folder *Data*
- **M3_data**: M3 competition data from *R* package *Mcomp*
- **production_Brazil**: Production in Brazil data, the set of observations of *9* agriculture products in meso-regions of [Brazil](https://www.ibge.gov.br)
- **real_ts**: benchmark empirical data, the set of *8* selected data sets from [*UEA \& UCR Time Series Classification Repository*](www.timeseriesclassification.com) and the *18Pairs* data set from *R* package *TSclust*  
- **ts_models**: Data Generating Processes, the set of *11* linear and nonlinear time series models
<!--- - Each file is the current format: -->
<!--- - The folder *Data/realts* contains all the univariate time series data sets from *UEA \& UCR Time Series Classification Repository*. These data sets can also be downloaded [here](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php).
