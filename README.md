## Requirements
- R (>= 3.6.0)


## Configurations

### Data
- All the data sets can be found [here](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vanessa.silva/datasets/NetF/Data/) and a subset in the folder ***Data***.
	- **M3_data**: M3 competition data from *R* package *Mcomp*
	- **production_Brazil**: Production in Brazil data, the set of observations of *9* agriculture products in meso-regions of [Brazil](https://www.ibge.gov.br)
	- **real_ts**: Selected benchmark empirical data sets, namely, the set of *8* selected data sets from [*UEA \& UCR Time Series Classification Repository*](www.timeseriesclassification.com) and the *18Pairs* data set from *R* package *TSclust*  
	- **ts_models**: Data Generating Processes (DGP), the set of *11* *linear* and *nonlinear* time series models
- All the univariate time series data sets from *UEA \& UCR Time Series Classification Repository* can be found [here](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vanessa.silva/datasets/NetF/Data/realts/). Can also be downloaded [here](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php).
	- Datasets are stored in *.RData* files and are in the following formats:
		- matrix of *ts* objects, ie. *mts*, for the **ts_models** dataset
		- list of *ts* objects, for the remaining datasets
- All the complex networks (*Visibility Graphs* and *Quantiles Graphs*) generated from the time series data sets can be found [here](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vanessa.silva/datasets/NetF/Graphs/).
	- The networks/graphs are in *R* *igraph* format and stored in *.RData* files.
- All the feature vectores (from ***NetF***, ***tsfeatures***, ***Rcatch22***) can be found [here](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vanessa.silva/datasets/NetF/Metrics/).
- All the empirical and experimental results can be found [here](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vanessa.silva/datasets/NetF/Results/).
